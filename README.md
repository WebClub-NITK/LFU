# LFU Cache implementation

Greetings from Web Club at NITK! :) We are looking to implement a cache described in the paper titled [An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme](http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf). The aim is to provide the user with a user-friendly, well-documented library for use in their own programs.

## Goal

The project aims to build a library which will provide a cache implementation through an API which provides the following basic functions:

* Import the cache/library module into a program.
* Initialize an empty cache.
* Insert an item into the cache.
* Lookup for an item.
* Remove an existing item from the cache.

## Contributing 

* If you are looking to contribute code, kindly look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for information as to how to contribute to the repository!

* If you are implementing the above logic in a programming language X, make sure you name your git branch as `X` and raise a PR for the same. If it already exists, try making it better!

* Benchmark your programs against a test suite. We will be adding the module soon. Comparing different implementations hence becomes easier.

* If there are any improvements, raise issues. Try to not ping specific members since some of us might be busy. We will respond soon.
