# LFU Cache implementation

This project implements a cache described in the paper titled [An O(1) algorithm for implementing the LFU cache eviction scheme](http://dhruvbird.com/lfu.pdf). It provides the user with a user-friendly, well-documented library for use in their own programs.

The project includes a library which provids a cache implementation through an API providing the following basic functions which are carried out in constant time (O(1)):
- Importing the cache/library module into a program.
- Initializing an empty cache.
- Inserting an item into the cache.
- Looking up for an item.
- Removing an existing item from the cache.
